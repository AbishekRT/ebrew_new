$peakTimes = CartActivityLog::raw(function($collection) {
    return $collection->aggregate([
        ['$match' => ['user_id' => $userId]],
        ['$project' => ['hour' => ['$hour' => '$session_start_time']]],
        ['$group' => ['_id' => '$hour', 'count' => ['$sum' => 1]]],
        ['$sort' => ['count' => -1]]
    ]);
});

### Service Pattern Implementation

```php
// Dependency injection in controller
public function __construct(CartInsightsService $cartInsightsService)
{
    $this->cartInsightsService = $cartInsightsService;
}

// Cached analytics retrieval
$insights = Cache::remember("user_insights_{$userId}", 300, function() {
