## Railway Deployment Fix for Asset Loading

### Issue Summary
The Laravel application is running on Railway but CSS/JS assets are not loading properly, causing the website to appear unstyled.

### Root Cause Analysis
After investigation, the assets are being built correctly (manifest.json exists with proper file references), but the URLs generated by Laravel's `@vite` directive are incorrect in production.

### Required Railway Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your Railway project:

```bash
# Critical: Set to your Railway domain
APP_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app

# Production settings
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false

# Optional: Force HTTPS for asset URLs
ASSET_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

### Key Files Updated

1. **railway.toml** - Railway deployment configuration
2. **start.sh** - Production startup script
3. **Debug route** - `/debug/assets` to check asset loading
4. **Environment fixes** - Proper URL configuration

### Testing Steps

1. Deploy to Railway with updated environment variables
2. Visit `/debug/assets` to verify:
   - APP_URL is set correctly
   - Manifest.json exists and has proper content
   - Vite asset URLs are generating correctly
3. Check browser developer tools for:
   - 404 errors on CSS/JS files
   - Mixed content warnings (HTTP vs HTTPS)
   - Console errors

### Manual Fix If Still Not Working

If the issue persists, you can temporarily use the backup styling layout:

1. Rename current layout: `mv resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php resources/views/layouts/app-vite.blade.php`
2. Copy backup: `cp resources/views/layouts/temp-styling.blade.php resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
3. This uses inline CSS that doesn't depend on Vite

### Common Railway Issues

1. **Mixed Content**: Railway uses HTTPS, ensure APP_URL uses `https://`
2. **Asset Path**: Vite might generate wrong URLs if APP_URL is `localhost`
3. **Cache**: Clear Laravel caches after environment changes
4. **Build Process**: Ensure assets are built during Docker build, not runtime

### Verification Commands

Run these in Railway console to debug:

```bash
# Check if assets exist
ls -la /var/www/html/public/build/

# Check manifest content
cat /var/www/html/public/build/manifest.json

# Check Laravel config
php artisan config:show app.url
php artisan config:show app.env

# Clear caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```
