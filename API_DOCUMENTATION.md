```javascript
{
    "anomaly_score": 8.5,
    "risk_factors": [
        "Multiple IP addresses in short time",
        "Unusual login times",
        "New device detected"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
        "Enable 2FA",
        "Review recent activity",
        "Update password"
    ]
}
```

## 📈 MongoDB Advanced Features Showcase

```javascript
// Example: User behavior analysis
db.user_analytics.aggregate([
    { $match: { user_id: 123 } },
    { $unwind: "$security_events" },
    { $group: {
        _id: "$security_events.type",
        count: { $sum: 1 },
        avg_risk: { $avg: "$security_events.risk_level" }
    }},
    { $sort: { avg_risk: -1 } }
])
```
